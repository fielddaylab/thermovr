do
- clipboard has "hidden" 4th tab for when you answer a question, shows a "correct!" or "incorrect!" or something before fading back to 3rd tab (and refreshing question, and deselecting options)
- finish implement challenge mode (can also use 4th tab)

- quiz questions based on john pdf (T < Tcrit? what region? etc...)
- bias tool dials (1/2 range should be "low", 1/2 range should be "high"- given logarithmic differences in perception/effect, it currently (linear scale) feels like 90% of slider range is "large"
- DISABLE BALLOON/WEIGHT DELTAS WHEN NOT IN SUPERHEATEDVAPOR REGION!
- "add pressure"/"remove pressure" are NOT persistent- they are relative to an absolute (ie, if I have a 50lb weight, and increase the weight to 55lb, then we've "add_pressure"'d 5lbs, once). should probably implement where "set weight" is actually a "target pressure", and the game adds/removes pressure to meet the target over time?
- figure out how to handle "x out of range" style errors
- need icons on sliders!

-implement "stops" instead of "clamp": would need to give lower stop and upper stop their own dial, and DISALLOW moving the dial beyond where the piston is, even if it wouldn't _necessariliy_ be problematic (that is, the piston can only be _moved_ via pressure, and the stops would NOT be allowed to contribute ANY pressure)

reference points:
- critical point
- triple line

- hilight the thing you're touching
- isolate qtext hitboxes
- swap/size clamp model
