- "correct answer!" feedback for quiz/challenge
- ensure "new challenge" isn't already colliding with state ball
- quiz questions based on john pdf (T < Tcrit? what region? etc...)
- get coherent min/max values for all state variables
- bias tool dials (1/2 range should be "low", 1/2 range should be "high"- given logarithmic differences in perception/effect, it currently (linear scale) feels like 90% of slider range is "large"
- appropriate tool visualizations (eg, max burner should be INFERNO, max weight should be ELEPHANT, etc...)
- container needs to be waaay taller...
- DISABLE BALLOON/WEIGHT DELTAS WHEN NOT IN SUPERHEATEDVAPOR REGION!
- need icons on sliders!
- implement "stops" instead of "clamp": would need to give lower stop and upper stop their own dial, and DISALLOW moving the dial beyond where the piston is, even if it wouldn't _necessariliy_ be problematic (that is, the piston can only be _moved_ via pressure, and the stops would NOT be allowed to contribute ANY pressure)

reference points (would be nice to visualize):
- critical point
- triple line

- hilight the thing you're touching (as opposed to the hands)

CAN CERTAINLY DO QUICK:
- swap/size clamp model when active
